# TumblrLeecher

A partial implementation of the Tumblr api written in C# with love.

There is no support for update and post functions at the moment, but the implementation is sufficient to archive a tumblr completely.

I release the sources of this program as it is a somewhat important amount of work, and I think it might be useful to someone aside from me.
